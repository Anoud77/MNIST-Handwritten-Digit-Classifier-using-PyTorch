# 🔢 MNIST Handwritten Digit Classifier using PyTorch

This project is part of the **AWS Machine Learning Fundamentals** specialization and demonstrates the ability to build, train, and optimize a fully connected neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a prototype Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system using the classic **MNIST dataset**, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9). This proof of concept is intended for future integration into products requiring digit recognition capabilities.

Using **PyTorch**, this project covers:
- Dataset loading and preprocessing
- Data visualization and transformation
- Building a custom neural network from scratch
- Model training and optimization
- Accuracy evaluation and performance tuning
